# Scientific Linux 7 Base Image baked by EuroLinux

You might ask why we bother and make another Scientific Linux image. Well, we commercially support any flavour of Enterprise Linux - Scientific Linux included. Our images are automatically rebuilt (once a month). Constantly rebuilt images are:

- More secure.
- Have predictable updates. 
- The change process is more stable.
- The infrastructure/scripts/workflow for ad-hoc fixes (ex. critical security) are in place.
