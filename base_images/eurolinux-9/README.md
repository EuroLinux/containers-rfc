# EuroLinux 9 beta - official image.

Welcome to official EuroLinux 9 beta! EuroLinux 9 is offered in Open Core model,
so you can use and redistribute this image freely.

Our images are automatically rebuilt (once a month). Constantly rebuilt images are:
- More secure.
- Have predictable updates. 
- The change process is more stable.
- The infrastructure/scripts/workflows for ad-hoc fixes (ex. critical security) are in place.

Note: EuroLinux 9 images have full EuroLinux repositories enabled by default.
To mimic restricted UBI like images disable all certify repo and enable FBI
repo.
